Rails come with a lot of conventions…
=====================================
One of them is that it assumes a bunch of things when creating a new application. Sometimes, I like having a completely clean project, and this application builder will generate one for me.

Why would I use it?
-------------------
I’d recommend you not to. But if you really want to, go ahead!

Usage

rails new appname --builder=https://github.com/Burgestrand/rails-templates/raw/master/slim/slim_builder.rb

Rails… templates?
=================
Ya. Most of my Rails project share some common settings, gems and so on. However, not all projects look the same, which means I always need to configure them for my tastes anyway.

It’s similar to the [html5 boilerplate](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate), but since this is ruby we don’t have to download everything, and then remove things by hand.

Project layout
--------------
Each directory is given the same name as to what it sets up. It will contain a runnable application template, as well as a README summarizing what settings and changes will be made to your application.

If that sounds complicated, just browse the repository. It’s bound to clear up some question marks. :)

Still… what is a rails template?
----------------------------------
A rails template is a generator that can make changes to your project. But instead of installing the generator as a gem and then running it, you just run a given file right there on the spot. You can put them in local files, github gists, or like I have done: in a github project.
